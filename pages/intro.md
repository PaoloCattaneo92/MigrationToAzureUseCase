# Introduction
If you are reading this you are probably interested about Microsoft Azure, the Cloud solution of Microsoft. During last years I have worked on the Azure cloud for some end customer solutions and I have been preparing for my certifications exams, in particular the ones to become Cloud Expert (AZ-900, AZ-104 and AZ_305).

In order to prepare for them, because there is actually *a lot* of content to cover, I made myself an exercise to put in practise everything that I have learnt during my study. This repo is the output of this exercise

## Author
I am Paolo Cattaneo and I am a Senior Software Engineer and Cloud Architect, with experience on developing software on the .NET stack, both on premises and on Cloud. As you can judge by the format of this "website" you can also deduct that my passion is more on the back-end than about the front-end. Maybe in the future I will setup a proper blog but for now I just wanted to share my work with the whole internet.

## MySense wanna go to Cloud
<img src="../img/mysense_logo.png" width="250" />

MySense is a fictional company that has a fictional software solution in the IoT world. This product is the one that must be migrated to cloud, and it is described completely in the following section. The names involved, the product, and the structure as the company itself is fictional, any link to reality is a mere coincidence.

## Open to feedback!
The goal of this work is for me as training and application exercise. Also, they say that you know something only when you can both apply and explain it in a easy way. So I am putting myself at test trying to do both here. That being said, despite my best efforts, I acknowledge that my work is not infallible, and I am open to suggestions and advices, so if something sounds wrong to you please help me work around it and make it better.
